🧙‍♂️ Highest carefully selected by the community & automatic Shitcoin rewards 🧙‍♂️

The Wizard is a generous old man. What he cares about most is that his holders are rewarded with qualities shitcoin. To do this, each week, the community will have to vote for the new token that will be designated as a reward. 

The voting feature will be delivered with a dapp : The Shitcoin Portal. To be able to vote for project, user will have to connect his wallet to the dapp and hold an amount of $SHIW we have not fixed yet. This will help mitigate bot manipulation of elections and offer $SHIW holders even more rewards.
